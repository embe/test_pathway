This repository contains examples of data processing using [Pathway](https://pathway.com/developers/documentation/introduction/welcome), the Python-based programming framework for easy building of realtime and reactive data products.. 

To run the examples, please [register](https://pathway.com/developers/documentation/introduction/installation-and-first-steps) to get access to the beta pip package.

For a quick start, you may want to check out, for instance, our [Pagerank implementation](tutorials/pagerank.ipynb) prepared as a Jupyter notebook, runnable directly from [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pathwaycom/pathway-examples/blob/main/tutorials/pagerank_colab.ipynb).

The talk "Reactive Data Processing in Python" at PyData Global 2022 [[slides]](/Pathway%20-%20PyData%20Global%202022.pdf) [[video]](https://vimeo.com/pathwaycom/pydata2022) also provides an introduction to Pathway and this repo.
