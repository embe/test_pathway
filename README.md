This repository contains examples of data processing using [Pathway](https://pathway.com/developers/documentation/guide/welcome), the Python-based programming framework for easy building of realtime and reactive data products.. 

To run the examples, please [register](https://pathway.com/developers/documentation/guide/getting-started) to get access to the beta pip package.

For a quick start, you may want to check out, for instance, our [Pagerank implementation](notebooks/pagerank.ipynb) prepared as a Jupyter notebook, runnable directly from [Google Colab](https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-examples/blob/main/notebooks/pagerank_colab.ipynb).
